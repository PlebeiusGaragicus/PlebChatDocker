Work in progress... not ready for use.  Feel free to look around.

## TODO:

 - Feature Request with open webui - like Chainlit I'd like the ability for an agent to begin a new thread with either a readme and/or LLM call or custom code.  On a new thread it could run arbitrary code to display updates, show user token balance, show help, and/or begin the conversation with an LLM call based on a system prompt.
